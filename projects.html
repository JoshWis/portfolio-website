            This was my first ever project since being introduced to the world of code. It was a team project, and my team consisted of 3 of us. I was nominated to be project leader/lead dev. This was more just a title given so that if there was something the group was unsure of, I would be the one to decide which outcome we would go with. This is a role I was very happy to be assigned and it taught me a lot in a little amount of time about how important it is to have a project lead for making those final decisions when there may be some confusion within the group.
