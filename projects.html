            This was my first ever project since being introduced to the world of code. It was a team project, and my team consisted of 3 of us. I was nominated to be project leader/lead dev. This was more just a title given so that if there was something the group was unsure of, I would be the one to decide which outcome we would go with. This is a role I was very happy to be assigned and it taught me a lot in a little amount of time about how important it is to have a project lead for making those final decisions when there may be some confusion within the group.

            This is the second project I had created but the first project which I did by myself. This was a big learning curve, since it was done using 2 new languages (HTML and CSS), but I really enjoyed being able to get creative and really showcase information about myself in this way. This project is the current website you're looking at, 4 pages, a home page, about page, projects page and a page for getting in contact with me.
