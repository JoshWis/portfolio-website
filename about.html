        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Computers and games consoles have been apart of my life since I can remember, but coding isn't something I'd ever tried before. I had once tried to learn HTML on my own but design isn't my strong suit and it never clicked with me. I'm interested in learning back-end programming/engineering/cyber security. I've tried many career paths but none of them were right for me. Until I joined Code Nation and I really dived into coding, I finally found something I am passionate about. Python is the first language I have learnt and it definitely will not be the last, as I'd like to make this my permanent career path. I'd like to learn more about what roles are available in the industry and choose what I feel like is right for me.</p>
